# Arduino mini based plant waterer thingy.

I made this about 10 years ago, used to have a video of it operating, but such things are lost to time.


I have posted v2 for the lulz. I have a bunch of different versions that wasn't version controlled properly so all seem to be marked 'v0.2' and have the same date internally but have significantly different code.

I think this might be the more up to date/functioning one, but I only did a brief comparison in vscode.

Pretty much posting just for others to laugh at my bad C++/Arduino code. I'd like to say I've improved, but I'll always be a mediocre programmer at best.
